# Lab 08: Students and Birds

## Overview
This project implements three functionalities in Rust:
1. Reverse a string.
2. Count the number of oldest students from a dataset.
3. Analyze bird sighting logs to find the most frequently observed birds.

The lab emphasizes modularity, efficient data processing, and Rust programming principles.

## Tasks
1. **Reverse a String**: Implement a function to reverse a given string without using built-in `rev()` methods.
2. **Count Oldest Students**: Parse student data to find and count the students with the highest age.
3. **Bird Sightings Analysis**:
   - Count the most frequent bird sightings.
   - Identify the most frequent bird (with or without order constraints).

## Usage
To build, test, and run the program, follow these steps:

```bash
# Run the program
cargo run

# Run tests
cargo test
